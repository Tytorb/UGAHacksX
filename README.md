## **Purpose of the Project**  
Our project is designed to inspire **adventure** and **well-being**. With a creative nod to music lovers, we aim to enrich people's lives in two key ways:  

### **1. Encouraging Exploration**  
We believe that experiencing new places and connecting with nature is essential for personal growth and fulfillment. However, finding the motivation to step outside can be challenging. That’s where we come in—by providing a sense of purpose, we make exploration more accessible and exciting.  

### **2. Promoting Physical Health**  
Movement is vital for a long, healthy life. Our project encourages people to stay active through travel, whether it's hiking, biking, or simply discovering new landscapes. By combining **adventure** with **well-being**, we make fitness feel less like a chore and more like an experience.  

At its core, our mission is simple: **to inspire people to explore, move, and live more fulfilling lives.**

## **Encountered Problems**  
One of the major challenges we faced was getting storage to work on the ESP32, as it only has flash memory. Unlike traditional storage interfaces, we had to figure out how to write to flash memory efficiently.  

Another significant hurdle was **Bluetooth communication** between the ESP32 and connecting devices. Establishing a stable connection required extensive troubleshooting, and at times, borderline brute force. After countless **forum deep dives** and **Google searches**, we finally cracked the problem and got everything working as intended.
